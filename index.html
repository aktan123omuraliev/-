            <h1> Pepsi History</h1>
            <p>In 1931 the company’s trademark and assets were picked up by Charles G. Guth (1876–1948), founder of the modern Pepsi-Cola. He established a new Pepsi-Cola Company, had a chemist formulate a better drink, set up new bottling operations, and began merchandising a hugely successful 12-ounce bottle for five cents. Guth was also president of Loft, Incorporated, a candy manufacturer and soda-fountain chain (founded 1919), and in legal battles in 1936–39 he lost a controlling interest in the Pepsi-Cola Company to the new management of Loft. When in 1941 the Pepsi-Cola Company was merged into Loft, the name Loft, Inc., was changed to Pepsi-Cola Company.
                In 1950 Alfred N. Steele (1901–59), a former vice president of Coca-Cola Company, became chief executive officer. His emphasis on giant advertising campaigns and sales promotions increased Pepsi-Cola’s net earnings 11-fold during the 1950s and made it the chief competitor of Coca-Cola. (After Steele’s death, his wife, actress Joan Crawford, became an active director of the company.) In 1965 Pepsi-Cola merged with Frito-Lay, Inc., the maker of snack foods such as Fritos, Doritos, Lay’s potato chips, and Rold Gold pretzels. The newly enlarged company diversified further with the purchase of three restaurant chains—Pizza Hut, Inc. (1977), Taco Bell Inc. (1978), and Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. (1986; now called KFC)—and Seven-Up International (1986), but in 1997 the restaurant chains were spun off into a new, separate company called Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. Looking to add more products that were considered healthier, PepsiCo acquired the Tropicana and Dole juice brands from the Seagram Company in 1998, and in 2001 it merged with the Quaker Oats company to form a new division, Quaker Foods and Beverages. With the merger, PepsiCo’s popular brands included Pepsi cola, Frito-Lay snack products, Lipton Tea, Tropicana juices, Gatorade sports drinks, Quaker Oats cereals, and Rold Gold pretzels.

                History of soft drinks
The first marketed soft drinks appeared in the 17th century as a mixture of water and lemon juice sweetened with honey. In 1676 the Compagnie de Limonadiers was formed in Paris and granted a monopoly for the sale of its products. Vendors carried tanks on their backs from which they dispensed cups of lemonade.

Carbonated beverages and waters were developed from European attempts in the 17th century to imitate the popular and naturally effervescent waters of famous springs, with primary interest in their reputed therapeutic values. The effervescent feature of the waters was recognized early as most important. Flemish scientist Jan Baptista van Helmont first used the term gas in his reference to the carbon dioxide content. French physician Gabriel Venel referred to aerated water, confusing the gas with ordinary air. British scientist Joseph Black named the gaseous constituent fixed air.


Robert Boyle, an Anglo-Irish philosopher and scientist who helped found modern chemistry, published his Short Memoirs for the Natural Experimental History of Mineral Waters in 1685. It included sections on examining mineral springs, on the properties of the water, on its effects upon the human body, and, lastly, “of the imitation of natural medicinal waters by chymical and other artificial wayes.”

Numerous reports of experiments and investigations were included in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in the late 1700s, including the studies of Stephen Hales, Joseph Black, David Macbride, William Brownrigg, Henry Cavendish, and Thomas Lane.

English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley is nicknamed “the father of the soft drinks industry” for his experiments on gas obtained from the fermenting vats of a brewery. In 1772 he demonstrated a small carbonating apparatus to the College of Physicians in London, suggesting that, with the aid of a pump, water might be more highly impregnated with fixed air. French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier made the same suggestion in 1773.

To Thomas Henry, an apothecary in Manchester, England, is attributed the first production of carbonated water, which he made in 12-gallon barrels using an apparatus based on Priestley’s design. Swiss jeweler Jacob Schweppe read the papers of Priestley and Lavoisier and determined to make a similar device. By 1794 he was selling his highly carbonated artificial mineral waters to his friends in Geneva; later he started a business in London.
